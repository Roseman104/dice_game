# Farkle

### Currently addicted to the game in Kingdom Come Deliverance II

#### Game starts and the two players just roll. You can read what happens. 

Excuse to write something in Rust. (Mostly ChatGPT)



## [Farkle Rules](https://www.officialgamerules.org/board-games/farkle)


This program is a test of what I want to develop in the future. 
- Add human interactions, choose to play as player1 or 2.
- Develop Farkle Picker - Program used by player in KCD2 to choose wether to continue or not. Show probability of next hand etc.
- Add questions to the top of the game to allow user to choose wether or not to play and what the point value should be to. 
- Add backend database to gather player statistics.
